.. py:currentmodule:: pngglitch

Version 1.1.0
-------------

*Released July 19, 2019*

* Switch license from GPL 2.0 to Apache.

* Make project compatible with setuptools.

  This means it is now possible to install Pngglitch via ``python setup.py
  install``.

* Use Sphinx for documentation.

* Fix bogus null-byte escape sequence in `GlitchedPNGFile.fill_zeros()`.

* Fix self-modification bug in `GlitchedPNGFile.random_glitches()`.

  The iterator would modify the original PNG file even though there is no
  necessity for it. Now, ``self`` stays unmodified throughout the iteration.

* Fix missing verification of the PNG header in files loaded via `PNGFile`.

  Now, files that don't have the magic PNG header are always rejected.

* Fix missing verification of chunk type length in `Chunk` constructor.

  The constructor now ensures that the passed type is exactly four bytes long.

* Fix buggy end-of-file detection in `PNGFile`.

  The contructor would stop loading chunks as soon as it encountered a chunk
  without paylod. Now it correctly stops only when the IEND chunk is
  encountered.

* Deprecate fragile attributes of `Chunk`.

  The attributes `~Chunk.length`, `~Chunk.crc` and `~Chunk.raw_data` are
  technically public, but modifying them easily leads to an inconsistent chunk
  state. They are deprecated in favor of the `~Chunk.data` property.
