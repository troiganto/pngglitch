Pngglitch
=========

A Python script that puts glitch effects into PNG files.

Usage on the command-line:
--------------------------

* ``pngglitch input.png``

  Introduces glitches into the file *input.png* and saves the result as
  *input.corrupted.png*.

* ``pngglitch -o output.png input.png``

  Introduces glitches into the file *input.png* and saves the result as
  *output.png*.

* ``pngglitch -N 10 input.png``

  Makes 10 different attempts at glitching the file input.png. The resulting
  files are saves as *input.0.png* through *input.9.png*.

* ``pngglitch -N 10 -o "corrupt file %d.png" input.png``

  Makes 10 different attempts at glitching the file input.png. The resulting
  files are saves as *corrupt file 0.png* through *corrupt file 9.png*.

  The parameters ``-a``, ``-m``, and ``-d`` change the amount, size and size
  variation of glitches. Just play around with them and see what has the best
  results.

Usage in Python:
----------------

This script offers a class *GlitchedPNGFile* that enables the user to partially
decompress a PNG file and deliberately put errors into it's bytestream.

The constructor of *GlitchedPNGFile* takes a PNG file name and reads in the
chunks of the given file. After that, you can call the *glitch_file()* method
to insert random errors into the file. The *glitch_file()* method iterates over
the resulting image files. You can write these to disk via their write method.

You can also call various glitch effect methods directly, but you have to wrap
these calls between calls to *start_glitching()* and *end_glitching()*.  The
former decompresses the file, the latter compresses it again and portions the
data into equally-sized chunks again.
